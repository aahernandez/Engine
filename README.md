# Engine
## Description
This is the engine I built that I use with all of my projects.

## Build
Each project builds the engine as a library. The engine and projects are built using Visual Studio 17. If you would like to build any of the projects yourself, you can open the project's visual studio solution to do so. You must have a copy of this engine to build it, and the engine and projects must both have the same parent folder like so:

|—parent folder  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;|—Project1  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;|—Project2  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;|—Engine  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;|—Project3
